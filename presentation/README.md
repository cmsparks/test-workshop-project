# Presentation

This directory contains the presentation's project, implemented using vite and [reveal.js](https://revealjs.com/).

We can start presenting it with:

```sh
$ pnpm dev
```

This will start the presentation on http://localhost:5173, that's what we want to present.

On the browser window you can just press the `s` key to get a new window with the speaker view (and the speaker notes).

When the app is being served you can go to http://localhost:5173/?print-pdf to get the HTML ready to be printed
as a PDF and shared (that's the one that we'll ultimately make available).
